C) The problem is that we are getting count to infinity scenario. After removal
of the link B -> C and C -> B, the table has to be updated again and again
before it converges to infinity. This leads to wastage of compuation power,
as well as the a lot of data will be lost in case the router is trying to send
something before the table is getting updated.

To overcome this, we can use poison reverse technique, which has been
implemented in Q3.
